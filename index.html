                <strong style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">Hello World!</strong> My name is Ali, a computer engineer, technology enthusiast, searching and googling guru and computer geek. Currently going through career path transition by attending a <a target="_blank" href="http://houstoncodingbootcamp.com">coding bootcamp</a> powered by university of Texas and also other online courses. I'm planning on combining my new skills ,supported by my motivations and passion, with other transferable  proven skills that I gained and mastered through a very successful 4 years of working as a wireline lead engineer at Schlumberger, The oil services giant, skills that include team leading, project management, proven problem solving skills, adaptibility and self-development, and looking for a company where I can use this combination. I enojoy doing things, like writing a code and building a website, with thinking out of the box approach, and also enjoy the participation with a team to build a fully functional and responsive web sites and applications that represent the soul and the quality of the company to its audience and customers.
            </p>
